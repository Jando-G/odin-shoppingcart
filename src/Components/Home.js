          Hi welcome to this really bad website. I was being overly ambitious and attempted to
          make a fully fleshed out website where you can purhcase jokes from with cookies 
          from a JokeAPI even have them emailed to you. I ended up scrapping the email idea entirely
          and I gave up on a lot of other parts of the website. The main lesson I took away
          from this experience is that I really need to let myself give up quicker especially
          since this is just for fun. I ended wasting a lot of time this past month and
          didn't learn nearly as much as I would have doing other projects.
